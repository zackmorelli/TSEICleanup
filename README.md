# TSEICleanup
Semi-automates TSEI plan creation in Eclipse

This is a Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI) script, for use with Eclipse, which is a commerical external beam radiation treatment planning system made by Varian Medical Systems. This is one of several scripts which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly.

There is a .docx README file that describes what the program does and how it is organized.
