# TSEICleanup

This program is for use with ARIA/Eclipse, which is a commerical radiation treatment planning software suite made by Varian Medical Systems which is used in Radiation Oncology. This is one of several programs which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly available.

There is also a .docx README file in the repo that describes what the program does and how it is organized.
